## PolyQuiz

An quiz website that's currently being used by some teachers at my alma mater and for the school's math placement test.

The currently running site is outdated, and was built with an older paradigm.

PolyQuiz 3 is being built with a seperate api backend and Polymer based front end, along with a new model for the quiz data.

Currently the codebase has the backend implemented in PHP with slim framework, but I am experimenting in a serverless backend that relies on AWS Lambda functions.
